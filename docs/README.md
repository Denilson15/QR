# QR Code Component

This is a custom-built QR code component developed from scratch using **HTML** and **CSS**. While the project idea was inspired by Frontend Mentor's QR code component challenge, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building responsive web components and mastering layout techniques.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a functional QR code component that includes:

- A centered card layout containing a QR code image
- A heading and descriptive text below the QR code
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices
